# Alpha Count

Welcome to Alpha Count! 

This is an interactive program that takes in a string of any length and counts how many letters you used.

Coded in C, this program reads user input and counts the amount of characters and which ones are used, recording them and delivering them in a sensible fashion once the user is finished typing. A special feature of this program is the ability to input text files into the command line which the program can also read from. Two have been provided in the repository for your convenience. 

This project was made as an assignment in ICS 212 where we learned how to use C and C++ very flexibly.

Enjoy!
